Ever since I played my first video game, I was intrigued about how it worked. When I was 13, I started messing around with Lua within the Roblox Studio engine. There, I learned the basics of code logic and flow. During the 2020 pandemic, my now step-mom bought me my first Python book for my birthday: [Coding for Kids: Python: Learn to Code with 50 Awesome Games and Activities](https://www.amazon.com/Coding-Kids-Python-Awesome-Activities/dp/1641521759). That was single-handedly the best birthday gift I have and will ever receive, for it introduced me to the world of computer programming. Since then, I have been hooked, learning languages like JavaScript with HTML and CSS, NodeJS frameworks like ReactJS and NextJS, TypeScript, and most recently, Java and C++.
